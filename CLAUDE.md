# Ralph Loop Methodology - Project Guide

This is a **methodology-only repository**. It contains the Ralph Loop autonomous feature development system, not project-specific code.

## What is Ralph Loop?

Ralph Loop is an autonomous 8-phase feature development system that executes the complete lifecycle from specification to production merge with minimal human intervention.

## The 8-Phase Cycle

```
1. INTERVIEW        → Capture technical decisions (spec.md)
2. THINK CRITICALLY → 11-step pre-implementation analysis (analysis.md)
3. PLAN             → Design architecture + tasks (design.md, tasks.md)
4. BRANCH           → Create isolated git worktree
5. IMPLEMENT        → Execute tasks with atomic commits
6. PR               → Auto-sync, auto-resolve conflicts, create PR
7. MERGE            → Human approval → Production
8. WRAP-UP          → Capture learnings (wrap_up.md)
```
