# Interview Feature (Spec Architect Mode)

## Purpose

Transform a rough feature idea into a **professional technical specification** through exhaustive interviewing. This is NOT a superficial Q&A - it's a deep dive into requirements.

Based on the Spec Architect methodology.

## Usage

```
"Interview me about FEAT-001-auth"
/interview FEAT-001-auth
```

## Instructions

### 1. Read Context

```bash
# Read the feature spec (may be empty template or rough notes)
cat docs/features/$ARGUMENTS/spec.md
```

Also read related context if exists:
- `docs/project.md` - Project overview
- `docs/architecture/_index.md` - Technical constraints
- Related features that this depends on

### 2. The Interview Loop

**YOU MUST ASK QUESTIONS. DO NOT ASSUME.**

Interview in extreme detail about:

#### Technical Implementation
- Data models and relationships
- API design (endpoints, payloads, responses)
- State management
- Error handling strategies
- Performance requirements
- Security considerations

#### UI & UX Flows
- User journey step by step
- What does the user see at each state?
- Loading states, empty states, error states
- Mobile vs desktop considerations
- Accessibility requirements

#### Edge Cases and Concerns
- What happens when X fails?
- What if user does Y unexpectedly?
- Concurrent users/requests handling
- Data validation rules
- Rate limiting needs

#### Trade-offs
- Speed vs reliability
- Simplicity vs flexibility
- Build vs buy decisions
- Database choices
- Caching strategies

║     Continue interviewing until YOU have a complete mental model              ║

║     Propose the most sensible default with reasoning                          ║

```

### 3. Update spec.md in Real Time

After EACH user response, update the spec.md file:

```markdown
## Technical Decisions

| # | Área | Pregunta | Decisión | Notas |
|---|------|----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Auth | OAuth failure handling | Retry 3x then show error | Claude recommended |
| 2 | Session | Token duration | 24h with refresh | User specified |
| 3 | Security | Failed login limit | 5 attempts then 15min lockout | User specified |
```

### 4. Interview Completion Check

Before ending, verify you have answers for:

- [ ] All user stories defined
- [ ] All acceptance criteria clear
- [ ] Technical approach decided
- [ ] Edge cases documented
- [ ] Error handling defined
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Out of scope clearly listed

Ask user: "I believe I have enough information to write the complete spec. Should I finalize it, or are there areas you want to discuss further?"

### 5. Final Output

When interview is complete:

1. Rewrite `docs/features/$ARGUMENTS/spec.md` with full professional specification
2. Update `docs/features/$ARGUMENTS/status.md`:
   - Phase: Interview ✅
   - Interview completed: [date]
3. Update `docs/features/_index.md` if status changed

### 6. Transition to Plan

After finalizing spec, tell user:

```
✅ Interview complete. spec.md has been updated with all decisions.

Next step: Run "/plan implement $ARGUMENTS" to create the technical design.
```

## Question Templates

### Opening Questions
- "Let's start with the core user flow. Walk me through exactly what happens when a user [main action]?"
- "Who are the different types of users for this feature? Do they have different permissions?"

### Deep Dive Questions
- "You mentioned [X]. What should happen if [edge case]?"
- "For the [component], are we prioritizing speed, reliability, or flexibility? We can only optimize for 2."
- "What existing patterns in the codebase should this follow?"

### Closing Questions
- "What's the one thing that would make you consider this feature a failure?"
- "Are there any integrations or future features this needs to support?"
- "What's explicitly NOT part of this feature?"
